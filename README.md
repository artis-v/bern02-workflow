# bern02-workflow
This repository stores a workflow for the assignment on workflows and environments in BERN02. The original work was Assignment 3 of the NUMA41 course in Numerical Analysis.

A `requirements.txt` file is provided, which pins the versions of the packages used. Version pinning guarantees that, if there are library updates that unexpectedly break or alter the functionality of the methods used, the results will still be reproducible. Over time, the used package versions will become outdated and their use could carry security risks - since the repository won't be maintained, users should be aware of these risks.
